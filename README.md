####Familiar with Git?#####
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
	> git clone git@github.com:joelbandi/redux-tutorial-selectors.git
	> cd ReduxSimpleStarter
	> npm install
	> npm start
```
###Getting Started###

1. Use `git checkout master` to checkout into master. Just go through the basic app src code.
2. Use `git checkout reiteration-of-design` to checkout the next stepped branch. See how the app code was restructured to set up a need for selectors.
3. Use `git checkout lets-try-reselect` to checkout into final branch. Read through the need for the selector how we already use a selector and but now were using better selectors to improve performance.
